i found the message where you mentioned features to add, here there are:

I'll provide a complete updated version of the TextView component with all the new features. Would you like me to break it down into sections after sharing the full code, so you can understand each new feature? The file will include:
Voice selection with cleaned-up names
Speed control buttons
Text highlighting
Progress indicator
Keyboard shortcuts
Section repeat functionality
Click-to-start-from-point feature
Would you like me to proceed with the complete file?
